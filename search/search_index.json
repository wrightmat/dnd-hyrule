When hit by a weapon such as a Sword, they will briefly morph into impenetrable rock statues and remain in that state for a few moments before transforming back into their normal, mobile form. Their statue form renders them invulnerable to nearly all attacks.</p>"},{"location":"Deadrock/#references","title":"References","text":"<ul> <li>https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Deadrock</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Ocarina%20of%20Time/","title":"Ocarina of Time","text":"<p>#item </p> <p>Wondrous item, legendary</p> <p>The Ocarina of Time, specifically a transverse ocarina (also known as a \"sweet potato ocarina\"), is an instrument used to play music.
