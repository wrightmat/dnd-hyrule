Deadrocks are bipedal, rock-based creatures that typically make their home on mountain ranges, such as Death Mountain. When hit by a weapon such as a Sword, they will briefly morph into impenetrable rock statues and remain in that state for a few moments before transforming back into their normal, mobile form. Their statue form renders them invulnerable to nearly all attacks.
