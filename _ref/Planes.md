### Material Planes – Upper

#### Sacred Realm

Also known as the Golden Land, the Sacred Realm is a holy world connected to the land of Hyrule, said to be the resting place of the Triforce. The three Golden Goddesses, once they finished the creation of the land of Hyrule and its inhabitants, left behind a symbol of their strength, the Triforce, before departing for the heavens. The land where they left behind the golden power was said to be the Sacred Realm. The realm is said to be of golden skies rather than the blue of Hyrule, and lies above Light World on the Material Plane’s upper half.

#### Light World

Also known as the Land of Hyrule, the Surface, and the Land of the Gods, this kingdom serves as the iconic setting for a majority of the Zelda canon. It is usually depicted as a beautiful and prosperous land blessed with deep forests, tall mountains, vast lakes, a barren desert, great cities, villages, and many ancient temples hidden throughout.

#### Dark World

The Dark World is a dimension parallel to the kingdom Hyrule, which is referred to as being a part the Light World in contrast, and a corrupted incarnation of the Sacred Realm. The Dark World was created in its current form when Ganondorf entered the Sacred Realm and obtained the Triforce of Power, copying the Sacred Realm and warping it to his dark desires. The dark world lies on the bottom of the Material Plane’s upper half.

### Material Planes – Middle

#### Twilight Realm

The Twilight Realm is a world of shadows and perpetual twilight whose only source of light comes from the two sacred orbs known as the Sols that are kept in a shrine near the plaza of the Palace of Twilight. The Twilight Realm is the home world of the Twili, a race of shadow-beings descended from the Dark Interlopers that were banished from Hyrule and sent to the Twilight Realm as punishment for their attempted conquest of the Sacred Realm. The Twilight Realm is the only known realm in the middle of the Material Plane, and lies nestled between the Dark Realms of the Material Plane’s lower and upper halves.

### Material Planes – Lower

#### Dark World

Little is known about the Dark World attached to Lorule. It may have been created at the same time as the upper half’s Dark World. Since the Material Plane’s upper and lower halves are mirrors of one another, Lorule’s Dark World lies closest to the Twilight Realm in the middle.

#### Light World

In ancient times this mirrored world of Hyrule was nearly destroyed when its Triforce was destroyed by the world’s leader, Princess Hilda. The world was restored by a wish on Hyrule’s Triforce by Princess Zelda.

### Sacred Realm

It is established that Lorule has its own version of the Sacred Realm. In a parallel version of the area shown in Hyrule's, there exists a large, cracked tablet that serves to link the two worlds. The Sacred Realm of the Material Plane’s lower half is the outermost point of the bottom of the circle.

### Outer Planes

#### Silent Realm (Upper, Center)

Most closely aligned with power, and parallel to the Evil Realm on the Lower Half. The realm appears as an alternate and dim version of the material plane, where the visitor will be completely defenseless. This realm is protected by the Guardians and Watchers, is most closely connected to the Distant Nebula Astral Plane, and can be accessed via Trial Gates with the Master Sword.

#### Dream Realm (Upper, Left)

Most closely aligned with wisdom, and parallel to the World of the Ocean King on the Lower Half. The realm is a transient creation of the mind of the realm’s protector, and can take many forms (also known as a “visionary world”). The only confirmed location within the realm is Koholint Island, and it accessed via the Great Sea in an unknown manner. This realm is protected by the Wind Fish.

#### Minish Realm (Upper, Right)

Most closely aligned with courage, and parallel to the Dark Realm on the Lower Half. The realm is home of the diminutive Minish race and appears as an unending beautiful forest. This Realm is connected to the Material Realm via the Minish Door that only opens once very briefly every 100 years, and is protected by the Minish themselves.

#### Evil Realm (Lower, Center)

Most closely aligned with power, and parallel to the Silent Realm on the Upper Half. Also known as the Demon World, home of all demons, and most closely connected to the Chaos Astral Plane.

#### World of the Ocean King (Lower, Left)

Most closely aligned with wisdom, and parallel to the Dream Realm on the Upper Half. This realm appears as a flooded world similar to the Material Realm’s Great Sea, and is ruled over by Oshus (the Ocean King).

#### Dark Realm (Lower, Right)

Most closely aligned with courage, and parallel to the Minish Realm on the Upper Half. This realm is ruled over by the Demon Train.

### Astral Planes

#### Distant Nebula

Original home of the Golden Goddesses.

#### Primordial Chaos

Original home of the demons and Demise.
