>These are the Koroks--the spirits of the forest. Once upon a time, long ago, the Koroks took on human forms, but when they came to live on the sea, they took these shapes. Now they fear people...but to me, they will ever be my cherished little children.

The Koroks are the race native to the forests of Hyrule. They are small, wooden people who wear leaf masks over their faces. Their personalities may differ greatly, and are often reflected in their masks. They are spirits who are watched over by the Great Deku Tree, and protectors of the forest they live in.

### Children of the Forest

The Koroks appear as little wooden people whose bodies resemble trees, and whose faces are concealed by leaf masks. The masks they wear take on various different shapes based on types of leaves, and have holes in them resembling eyes and a mouth, and occasionally a hole for their noses to fit through. Their bodies make a jingling sound whenever they move. Koroks are also able to fly through the use of propeller Deku Leaves that sprout from their bodies.

### Korok Names

The Koroks are often named after types of trees. They're also often two syllables long, with consonant pairs within the names.

While piloting the Hover Leaf, a Korok may hover and turn perfectly, as if walking on the ground. Hover Leaves may only be used by the Korok who built them.
