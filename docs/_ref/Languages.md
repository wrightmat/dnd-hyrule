Languages spoken by races and creatures dedicated to the Hyrule setting are rooted firmly in The Legend of Zelda series. If a DM would prefer to use any content in a more traditional Dungeons & Dragons setting, languages should be supplemented with more approximate equivalents listed in the table below.
