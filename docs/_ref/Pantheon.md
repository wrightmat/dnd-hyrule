Hyrule's pantheon can be arranged in three tiers. The most powerful deities, the three Golden Goddess, are represented in the center of the Key of Hylia. The next step outward are the nine true gods and goddess, with Hylia and Demise as the most powerful. Each of these are represented by an element along the ring of the Key. The minor gods and goddess, spirits, and other powerful beings are represented by the twelve symbols on the outside of the Key. Each of these represents a domain and is remediated by the element closest to it.
