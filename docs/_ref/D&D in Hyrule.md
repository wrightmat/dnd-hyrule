Welcome to a special edition of a Dungeons and Dragons adventure, set within the fictional world of Hyrule! For more information on this unique setting, please reference the Adventurers' Guide to Hyrule as well as Ganon's Guide to Monsters.

### Setting-Specific Rules

This setting uses a few modified rules, mostly variant rules from 5e or from previous versions of Dungeons and Dragons, in order to give a more Zelda-like feel to certain areas of gameplay. This mostly applies to dungeon crawling mechanics which aren't present in vanilla D&D 5e.

#### Dungeon Crawling

While in dungeons, each round takes six minutes (as opposed to six seconds for each round of combat), and tracking of time is important, as opposed to the overworld.

##### Sequence of Play Per Turn

- Wandering Monsters: The DM makes checks as applicable
- Actions: The party decides what action to take (e.g. moving, searching, listening, entering rooms)
- Description: The GM describes what happens
- End of Turn: The GM updates time records, with special attention to light sources, spell durations, and the party's need to rest.

##### Wandering Monsters

- Every turn while in the dungeon, the DM should roll a d6. A monster table will exist for every dungeon that will denote when and which monsters appear.
- Wondering monsters are encountered 2d6 x 10 feet away, moving in the direction of the party.
- If the party is making a lot of noise or carrying bright light sources in a dark environment, the DM may increase the chance of wandering monsters being encountered.
- If the party rests quietly in an out of the way location, the DM may decrease the chance of wandering monsters being encountered.
- Most monsters will not continue a pursuit if the characters get out of the monster's range of vision.
- If the monsters enjoy treasure, there is a 50% probability that they will stop pursuit to collect any treasure the characters drop.
- Hungry or less intelligent monsters may stop pursuit if the characters drop food (50% chance)

##### Searching

- Dungeons often include hidden features such as secret doors and traps.
- Adventurers can spot things by searching, which uses an Investigation check (DC 10 generally, but can increase to 15 or 20 for better hidden objects).
- The player must declare the particular area to be searched (10' x 10'), and the action takes one turn.
- Each character can only make one attempt to search an area.

##### Traps

- Treasure Traps: Small traps placed on an item, to prevent it from being tampered with or stolen.
- Room traps: Large traps that are designed to affect anyone who enters a certain area (e.g. a pit that opens in the floor when walked over).
- Each trap is triggered by a particular action. Each time a character makes an action that would trigger a trap, the player should roll a Perception Check against the trap DC (or 15). On a failed save, the trap is tripped and damage is taken automatically without any additional action or save.
- Monsters may be able to bypass traps without risk, if the DM wishes. Alternatively, the monster can be given advantage only so that the players can still trick monsters into traps in order to harm them.

##### Doors

Dungeons often have many doors, some secret and others obvious. Many are locked, and some may be stuck.

- Secret Doors: Secret doors can only be spotted if characters are specifically looking for them, via searching a particular area.
- Locked Doors: Locks may be picked by a character proficient with lock picks or magic, or opened by a found key.
- Stuck Doors: The chance of forcing open a stuck door depends on the character's strength. A failed attempt to force open a door eliminates any possibility of surprise that the party may have against any monsters on the other side of the door.
- Doors Swinging Shut: Doors opened by adventurers are likely to shut after they pass. To prevent this, doors may be held open using equipment (iron spike, wedge, etc) or magic.
- Monsters and Doors: Monsters that live in the dungeon can usually open doors (even stuck ones), unless they are blocked, magically closed, or wedged shut with spikes.
- Listening at Doors: PCs have a chance (Investigation Check) of detecting subtle sounds beyond the door. This attempt may only be made one time at any door by a character. Some monsters, such as undead, do not make any noise.
- Since doors can re-close or become stuck again, players may have to find a different route out of the dungeon than the way they came in.

##### Movement

- When exploring unknown areas of a dungeon, characters can move their movement rate in feet per turn. This rate of movement takes account for the fact that PCs are exploring, watching their footing, mapping, and trying to be quiet and avoid obstacles.
- When PCs are moving through dungeon areas with which they are familiar, the DM may allow them to move at a faster rate (such as two to three times their base rate when backtracking).

##### Marching Order

- When entering the dungeon, the PCs should establish a marching order. A marching order makes it easier to determine which characters are affected by traps, which ones can spot hidden enemies, and which ones are the closest to those enemies when a fight breaks out.
- A character might occupy the front rank, one or more middle ranks, or the back rank. Characters in the front and back ranks need enough room to travel side by side with others in their rank. When space is too tight, the marching order must change, usually by moving characters to a middle rank.
- Fewer Than Three Ranks. If an adventuring party arranges its marching order with only two ranks, they are a front rank and a back rank. If there’s only one rank, it’s considered a front rank.
- Any actions will be performed in marching order, usually from front to back, but not always. For example, if the party is attacked from the rear, then the back rank player would go first and play would proceed from back to front. Alternatively, if players are walking through a corridor and step on a trap, the player in the first rank would do their check first followed by all other players in rank order.

##### Resting

- Characters must rest for one turn every hour (ten turns) in the dungeon.
- If characters press on without resting, they gain a level of Exhaustion per turn (until they have rested for one turn).

##### Darkness

- Characters will usually want to bring a source of light with them on underground expeditions.
- A torch burns for one hour (ten turns), providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.
- Characters or monsters that carry a light in a dark environment are usually unable to surprise opponents, because the light gives their presence away.

##### End of Turn

- The GM needs to update time records at the end of each turn. The number of turns since the last rest should be incremented, the life (burn time) of torches should be decremented, and spell durations decremented. Keep in mind that since a turn in a dungeon is equal to six minutes, most spells will only last one or two turns.
- Any monster already present in the dungeon should be moved at this time. They can move their speed in feet per turn, and should generally move toward the party.

#### Magic Points

See [Spells (Hyrule Supplement)](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Spells_(Hyrule_Supplement))

Spellcasting classes available to player-characters use a version of the Spell Points variant rule described on page 288 of the Dungeon Master's Guide, referred to in this setting as Magic Points.

Magic points are used primarily to cast spells, and replace spell slots in this setting. Casting a spell requires the expenditure of a specific number of magic points. (See table below)

Initially, casting a spell requires expending a number of points equal to 1 + spell level. From 3rd level spells up, it requires 2 + spell level. From 6th level spells up, it requires 3 + spell level.

A character can cast a spell at a higher level than normal by expending additional magic points. For example, casting *magic missile*, a 1st-level spell, normally costs 2 magic points. It can be cast as a 3rd level spell, improving its damage output, by expending the magic points needed to cast a 3rd level spell — which is 5 magic points.

Spells of 6th level and higher are particularly taxing to cast. Once a character casts a spell of 6th, 7th, 8th, or 9th level, the character cannot cast a spell of that level again until after completing a long rest, even if there are magic points to spare.

Magic points are fully restored after a long rest. Some class features and magic items can restore a limited amount of magic points.

| Spell Level | Magic Cost |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| 1st	| 2 |
| 2nd	| 3 |
| 3rd	| 5 |
| 4th	| 6 |
| 5th	| 7 |
| 6th	| 9 |
| 7th	| 10 |
| 8th	| 11 |
| 9th	| 12 |

#### Stamina Points

Stamina points are expended mainly to make called shots, for certain class features, and for a few magic items. Only characters of certain classes gain stamina points.

Any character with stamina points can expend them in place of magic points. Doing so simply requires expending 1 stamina point for every 1 magic point that would need to be expended, but doing so is extra taxing, so any stamina points used in this way do not replenish until the character completes a long rest. Otherwise, stamina points are fully replenished upon completing a short rest.

#### Called Shots

Just before making an attack roll with a weapon or an unarmed strike, a player-character can make a called shot either by expending 2 stamina points, or by taking disadvantage on the attack roll. One cannot make a called shot if the attack roll would have disadvantage anyway.

A called shot generally aims for wherever the target is most vulnerable, such as gaps in a warrior's armor, or the large eye of an exposed insect. This kind of called shot maximizes the damage dice rolled on a hit (e.g., treating 1d8 as simply 8), including any extra dice rolled as part of a critical hit or from other sources.

Some creatures in Hyrule have specific weaknesses to called shots made against a part of its body, referred to as a "weak point." Generally, a player-character should be able to identify a weak point fairly easily unless it is specifically concealed. Making a called shot targeting a specific weak point (e.g. "I aim for its tail") induces a particularly debilitating condition or extra damage, as described under the Weak Point trait of a relevant creature.

#### Rupees Replace Coins

The primary currency in Hyrule is rupees (rp). These appear as small, uniformly shaped crystal gems. Different colors of rupees are of proportionally different value.

| Rupee  | Value  | Equiv.                 |
| ------ | ------ | ---------------------- |
| Green  | 1 rp   | 1 sp = 10 cp           |
| Blue   | 5 rp   | 5 sp = 50 cp           |
| Yellow | 10 rp  | 1 gp = 10 sp = 100 cp  |
| Red    | 20 rp  | 2 gp = 20 sp ( = 1 ep) |
| Purple | 50 rp  | 5 gp = 50 sp           |
| Silver | 100 rp | 1 pp = 10 gp = 100 sp  |
| Gold   | 300 rp | 3 pp = 30 gp           |

*Any item which would cost less than 1 silver (10 copper) effectively has a selling price of 1 rupee.*

#### Heavier Armor

See Equipment (DMG Chapter 5).

If you do not meet the Strength score requirement of the armor you are wearing, you are restricted as though you lack proficiency with that armor. This means you would have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and spells could not be cast.
