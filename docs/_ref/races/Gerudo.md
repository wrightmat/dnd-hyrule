The highly exclusive race of warrior women from the Gerudo desert are a sight to behold. As beautiful as they are deadly, the Gerudo march into combat with passion and drive. They may not live as long as the other races of Hyrule, but they will live life to its fullest because of this.

### Tanned and Fiery

The Gerudo have dark, tanned skin often paired with hair of fiery hues, red being the most common. They have pointed ears and pronounced pointed noses as defining facial features. Their large, sharp eyes offer an enchanting glare, which they often accentuate through the use of make-up.

The Gerudo women are proud of powerful bodies and dress accordingly, wearing long, light flowing fabrics, often showing their midriffs and golden jewelry adorned with gemstones. This theme carries on to their weaponry, as the Gerudo often adorn their signature scimitars, spears and bows in the same manner.

### An Amazonian Society

It is extremely rare that a Gerudo woman bares a male child. This has lead to a unique culture of sisterhood within the Gerudo. Despite being a race almost exclusively of women, they require males as mates which lead many Gerudo women to travel outside the walls of their capital of Gerudo Town to find mates. Within their oasis capital, the Gerudo bar all men from entering their home. Despite this, men from all around will attempt to enter their city only to be turned away time and time again by their skilled guards.

The Gerudo have detached themselves from the religions of the land, focusing on spirituality through honouring their ancestors.

### People of the Desert

The Gerudo hail from the desert which is their namesake, the Gerudo Desert. The harsh sands are hellishly warm during the day and frigidly cold at night, often plagued by sandstorms and at sometimes lightning storms. Despite these seemingly inhospitable conditions, the Gerudo have flourished.

Sport and transportation has come in the form of the native sand seals for the Gerudo. Surfing behind the beasts as a form of transpotation and competition amongst the women of the sands.

### In Pursuit of Dreams

Gerudo women have an adventurous heart, many heading out from their capital city of Gerudo Town in search of fame, fortune and romance.

Their home may offer many things, but there are some goals which it cannot satisfy as well. A Gerudo will travel in search of these unmet wants and needs.
