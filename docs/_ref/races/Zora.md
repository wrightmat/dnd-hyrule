Mysterious and lovely creatures, the Zoras are competent divers, lancers and jewel crafters. Living within a giant statue honouring their homeland, the Zora quietly interact with the world, protecting it from torrent which would swallow it whole.

### Smooth Skinned

The Zora are fish-like humanoids who have smooth, scaled skin of various hues and shades. Their heads, rather than growing hair, grow fin-like extremities which resemble aquatic creatures. Men and women do not differ greatly, with the men having more muscle mass while the women have some feminine traits such as small breasts and wider hips.

The Zoras tend to avoid clothing as a whole, opting to wear accessories instead. Headbands, necklaces, bracelets and anklets are all common among the Zora. Those who take up arms may wear sleek breast plates and bracers to help protect themselves.

### Old and New

The Zora live for a very long time, and this longevity impacts their society greatly. Those who are in power among the Zora stay there for a very long time, leading to strict adherence to tradition and grudges to be held for ages. This does not stop the young from dreaming and acting to bring change to their home. There is tension between the elders and the young often over the thought of changing their ways.

### Of the Lake

Zora's make their home in the water systems of the East. This region has many rivers and lakes all interconnected, along with large reservoires which the Zora protect. Their famous home of Zora's Domain is a giant sculpture, crafted from the large stores of ore located in their region, it demonstrates not only their skill as stonemasons, but their Zora pride.

### Safeguarding the Future

The Zora can live comfortably in their domain for their entire lives, without the need to stray too far from their home. Some Zora may leave their land in search of adventure or to see the world, but most will only step out into the world in search of assistance against imminent disasters.

Long distance travel is a problem for the Zora if they do not seek the shelter of water, as their skin will dry out over time, making them ill. While troublesome, this condition takes a few days time to set in, giving the Zora a wide breadth to find a body of water to tend to themselves properly.
