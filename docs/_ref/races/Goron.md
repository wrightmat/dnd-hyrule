>Just look at all those delectable rocks sprinkled on those mountains. I may not know a whole lot about this Calamity Ganon thing but mark my words, I'll protect this land of ours to the death.
-Daruk, the Goron Champion

Boisterous and powerful, the Gorons of Death Mountain carry a zeal for brotherhood like none other. These behemoths value strength and determination above all else. A love for metal work, mining and friendly competition amongst themselves are all keystones to Goron culture.

### Rocky and Robust

Gorons are a large race of humanoids with massive arms and bodies, along with short but powerful legs. Their fists are often larger than their heads. They live on a diet of rocks, leading to rocky growths to appear on their bodies, concentrating on their backs. Their rotund bodies also allow them to roll themselves into balls and travel at high speeds.

Gorons tend to wear minimal clothing. Most gorons wear durable, twisted fabric loincloths which are surprisingly fire resistant. They will also wear work helmets and or pieces of armour where appropriate.

### The Goron Brotherhood

Gorons are a genderless race, as males and females are indistinguishable. Instead everyone is known as a brother, and live in a brotherhood. They take great pride in their physical strength and enjoy testing their might against one another. This competition comes in many forms, including sumo wrestling, rolling races and rock climbing. Though they train and work hard, Gorons also know how to relax in style, making use of hot springs.

### Mountainous Dwellers

Gorons hail from Death Mountain, a volcanic mountain in the north. Thanks to the volcanic activity, rocks and minerals are plentiful and the Gorons have developed near great resistance to extreme heat.

### Protection of Lands

Gorons are a very hearty and accepting race of peoples. But to a threat against their home, they are staunch protectors. If a threat looms over their lands or their allies, they will set off on adventure to protect those in need.

### Goron Names

Goron names are fairly simple, having a guttural tone to them when spoken. There is a great deal of variance in name length though. Each syllable of the name should be stressed as its own section, instead of flowing smoothly.
