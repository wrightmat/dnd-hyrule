>Very few can achieve a mastery of the sky. Yet I have made an art of creating an updraft that allows me to soar. It's considered to be quite the masterpiece of aerial techniques, even among the Rito.
-Revali, the Rito Champion

From the western hinterlands known as the Tabantha Frontier, the Rito live in their modest village of huts and boardwalks, clinging to the side of a great rocky spire among valleys of coarsing winds. Here the Rito hunt and play in the great blue sky.

### Feathered Folks

The Rito are sometime referred as birdmen by the other races. Their plumages come in a wide range of colours. Behind their crests their hair grows long and wild, many keeping it in braids. Their appearances vary greatly between themselves, but males tend to have cool coloured plumage while women have warm coloured feathers. Their feathers provide a great deal of warmth, protecting them from the cold of their homelands.

These avian people tend to wear very light armour in battle or simple pieces of cloth and leather for clothing, preferring less restricting garments to allow them to fly.

### Prideful Warriors

The Rito are masters of aerial combat, combining skillful flight with archery to create a truly astonishing battle style. Together they defend their home from any threats, no matter the odds. The highest honour for a Rito is to be like their fallen champion Rivali, which leads most men to attempt to emulate his perfection in archery and flight. Their tribe is led by a hereditary chieftan.

Within the Rito culture, history is passed down through song and verse and their elders are revered with respect. For these people, to fly high in the sky is the greatest pleasure of all. When unable to do so, depression may set in for a Rito.

### Life on the Frontier

The Rito make their home in Rito Village, located in the Tabantha Frontier. This mountainous region is dotted with lakes, canyons and evergreen trees. Cold winds caress the land year round, making the nights especially cold for travellers.

### What Makes a Hero

All their lives, Rito hear of the feats of heroes from the past and are encouraged to be like them. This leaves a burning passion for Rito to walk the path of a hero, and discovering what that entails for themselves.
