Despite the fall of the Hyrule Kingdom, the Hylian race lives on. They make their home the world over, undeterred by the calamity which upset their society years ago. Many make an honest living in villages, while others have opened ranching services to adventurers. Hardships come and go, but the Hylians stand strong, ready to push forward for the betterment of all.

### Adaptable

Hylians are a humanoid race with rounded faces and pointed ears. They normally have fair skin tones and a range of hair colours. Generally they are average in build and height, coming out shorter than most races within the realm.

Hylians, with their seemingly average appearance, gain advantage through the use of equipment. Clothing is widely varied across the land for the Hylians. They easily adapt to whatever environment or job they are taking on. If there is a job to do, a Hylian can figure out a way to equip themselves for the task.

### Under One Kingdom

The Hylians' homelands are the rolling plains of central Hyrule. Many villages sprawled across the grasslands, allowing them to farm and manage their animals with ease. Through diplomacy and mutual assistance, the Hylians were able to form the Kingdom of Hyrule, bringing all other races into an alliance to protect against common enemies and bring peace.

### A Widespread People

Thanks to the relationships of the kingdom from the past and their ability to adapt to most environments, the Hylians have become scattered across the land. Able to put down routes wherever they were, or wander the countryside until they found a suitable homestead.

### Ambitious Travelers

Anywhere across the realm, people will be able to find a Hylian chasing their dreams. From chasing profits as a merchant, to doing their duty as a knight or mercenary, Hylians are always working hard across the world.
