*Rod, rare*

Once on each of your turns, you can cast *somaria* at its lowest level by using your action to perform a somatic component with this rod.

If you otherwise cast *somaria*, you can use this rod as the material focus, and doing so reduces the magic points you need to cast that spell by up to 5. This enables you to more easily cast the spell at higher levels.

>[!info] Somaria
>*2nd-level conjuration*
>
>**Casting Time**: 1 action
>**Range**: 10 feet
>**Components**: S, M (an iron cube one inch in diameter)
>**Duration**: 1 minute
>
>You create a 5-foot-diameter stone block in a 5-foot cube of open space in range. The stone block has AC 17, has 27 hit points, and has a damage threshold of 10. Despite its rigidity and size, this stone block only weighs only 500 lb. If you cast this spell again, a new block is created and the previous one abruptly vanishes.
>
>As a bonus action, you can end the spell early by detonating the block, causing bolts of flame to scatter over a wide radius. Any creature other than you within a 30 foot radius of the block must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d8 fire damage.
>
>**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the dimensions of the block increase by 5 feet and its weight doubles for every two spell levels above 2nd.
